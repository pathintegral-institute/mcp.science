These servers enable Al models (like Claude) to interact with scientific data, tools, and resources through a standardized protocol.\\n\\n## What is MCP?\\n\\n> MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.\\n>\\n> MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:\\n>\\n> - A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into\\n> - The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors\\n> - Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure\\n>\\n> Source: [https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)\\n\\n## Available servers in this repo\\n\\n#### [Example Server](./servers/example-server/)\\n\\nA example mcp server that help understand how mcp server works.\\n\\n#### [Materials Project](./servers/materials-project/)\\n\\nA specialized mcp server that enables Al assistants to search, visualize, and manipulate materials science data from the Materials Project database. A Materials Project API key is required.\\n\\n#### [Python Code Execution](./servers/python-code-execution/)\\n\\nA secure sandboxed environment that allows AI assistants to execute Python code snippets with controlled access to standard library modules, enabling data analysis and computation tasks without security risks.\\n\\n#### [SSH Exec](./servers/ssh-exec/)\\n\\nA specialized mcp server that enables AI assistants to securely run validated commands on remote systems via SSH, with configurable restrictions and authentication options.\\n\\n#### [Web Fetch](./servers/web-fetch/)\\n\\nA versatile mcp server that allows AI assistants to fetch and process HTML, PDF, and plain text content from websites, enabling information gathering from online sources.\\n\\n#### [TXYZ Search](./servers/txyz-search/)\\n\\nA specialized mcp server that enables AI assistants to perform academic and scholarly searches, general web searches, or automatically select the best search type based on the query. A TXYZ API key is required.\\n\\n## How to integrate MCP servers into LLM\\n\\nIf you're not familiar with these stuff, here is a step-by-step guide for you: [Step-by-step guide to integrate MCP servers into LLM](./docs/integrate-mcp-server-step-by-step.md)\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\n- [MCPM](https://mcpm.sh/): a MCP manager developed by us, which is easy to use, open source, community-driven, forever free.\\n- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/): An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust. You can install it by running:\\n  ```bash\\n  curl -sSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | bash\\n  ```\\n- MCP client: e.g. [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) / [Cursor](https://cursor.com) / [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/editor) / [Chatwise](https://chatwise.app/) / [Cherry Studio](https://cherry-ai.com/)\\n\\n### Integrate MCP servers into your client\\n\\nMCP servers can be integrated with any compatible client application. Here, we'll walk through the integration process using the [`web-fetch`](./servers/web-fetch/) mcp server (included in this repository) as an example.\\n\\n#### Client Integration\\n\\nWith MCPM, you can easily integrate MCP servers into your client application.\\n\\nBefore installing the server, you need to specify the client you want to add the server to.\\n\\nlist available clients:\\n\\n```bash\\nmcpm client ls\\n```\\n\\nspecify the client you want to add the server to:\\n\\n```bash\\nmcpm client set <client-name>\\n```\\n\\nthen add the server:\\n\\n```bash\\nmcpm add web-fetch\\n```\\n\\nYou may need to restart your client application for the changes to take effect.\\n\\nThen you can validate whether the integration installed successfully by asking LLM to fetch web content:\\n\\n- \\\"Can you fetch and summarize the content from https://modelcontextprotocol.io/?\\\"\\n- The `web-fetch` tool should be called and the content should be retrieved.\\n\\n#### Find other servers\\n\\nWe would recommend you to check [Available Servers in this repo](#available-servers-in-this-repo) or [MCPM Registry](https://mcpm.sh/registry/) for more servers.\\n\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}
